"""Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the code is doing:

Define a class called "Solution" which will contain a method called "topKFrequent". The method takes two arguments: "nums" which is the list of integers to be processed, and "k" which is the number of most frequent elements to return.

Create an empty dictionary called "count" which will be used to store the frequency count of each integer in the "nums" list.

Create an empty list called "freq" with length equal to len(nums) + 1. This list will be used to store the integers in "nums" based on their frequency count.

Loop through each integer in "nums" and update its frequency count in the "count" dictionary. If the integer is not already in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1.

Loop through each key-value pair in the "count" dictionary. For each pair, append the integer key to the list in the "freq" list at index equal to the count value.

Create an empty list called "res" which will be used to store the most frequent integers.

Loop through the "freq" list in reverse order (starting from the end). For each list of integers in the "freq" list, loop through each integer and append it to the "res" list.

Check if the length of the "res" list is equal to "k". If it is, return the "res" list since it contains the top K most frequent integers.

If the loop completes without returning a result (i.e. if there are less than K integers in "res"), return the "res" list."""
