## Codewars Kata

This is a repository for keeping my codewars kata (coding challenges).

The number followed by 'kyu' denotes the diffuculty, with 8 being the easiest, and 1 being the hardest.


## Running Tests

To run a test for a given problem you can use the `just` command as follows:

```
just <difficulty> <problem name>
```

eg.
```
just leetcode/medium top_k_frequent_elements
```
